    \brief          SimpleLinkNetAppEventHandler

    This handler gets called whenever a Netapp event is reported
    by the host driver / NWP. Here user can implement he's own logic
    for any of these events. This handler is used by 'network_terminal'
    application to show case the following scenarios:

    1. Handling IPv4 / IPv6 IP address acquisition.
    2. Handling IPv4 / IPv6 IP address Dropping.

    \param          pNetAppEvent     -   pointer to Netapp event data.
